## 👋 Hey, I'm Lindokuhle Dumakude Also Known as Malinga

I'm a student on a mission to become a full-stack developer. I started out writing basic markup like Hello World. Now I’m building responsive layouts, learning how to write cleaner code, and diving deeper into how the web actually works.

My approach is Build something, break it, figure out why it broke, and do it better next time.

Right now, I’m focused on frontend skills like responsive design and UI principles. But my long-term goal is to master both frontend and backend development — I want to be the kind of developer who understands the full system, not just one side of it.

## 🔁 My Coding Journey So Far

- 🟢 **Started with HTML & CSS** – Learning how to build structured, semantic websites
- 🔵 **Got into Tailwind CSS** – Making my layouts more responsive and modern
- 🟠 **Practicing Git & GitHub** – Managing code, tracking changes, and writing better commit messages
- 🔜 **Next up:** Learn JavaScript, focus on core logic, not just syntax

## 🎯 Goals I'm Chasing

- ✅ Build 3+ responsive web apps by year-end  
- 📥 Contribute to an open-source project for the first time  
- 💼 Land a junior developer role or internship by early next year
